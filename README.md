# BCM Codes

Welcome to the repository for the short course on Python and Data Analysis! This series of workshops is designed for medical students who want to get familiar with coding for use in medical research. The workshops will introduce you to the basics of Python programming and guide you through data analysis techniques relevant to medical research. Concepts are introduced and taught in the context of medical research using examples from the literature whenever possible.

## Course Contents

The course is structured into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of Python and data analysis. Below is an overview of the modules along with a link to the corresponding Jupyter Notebook:

1. **Getting Started (8/17)**: [_Jupyter Notebook_](https://github.com/aidanboyne/BCMCodes/blob/67c9f1adabfb886f8c5050103a68285c49e41784/GettingStarted.ipynb)
   - How to install python and Jupyter Notebooks
   - Variables, data types, and operators
   - Basics of Pandas DataFrames
  
Upcoming Workshops:
